I would like to nominate Cameron Diekonigin for the Fungal Outreach Award in recognition of his exceptional efforts in bringing together fungal enthusiasts of all levels throughout Scotland and the wider UK. He has been instrumental in promoting collaboration among a diverse group of mycologists, furthering the mission of the BMS, and producing comprehensive educational materials, engaging talks, and more. These contributions have helped build a stronger, interconnected community. His passion and dedication to outreach are essential to continue engaging the public's interest in fungi and motivating others to unite in advancing mycology.
